    There is an overwhelming quantity of data available to us in today's fast-growing, data-driven economy. Thousands of articles are written every day and made available through a variety of internet outlets. This may be incredibly intimidating and difficult to manage for the typical customer. This necessitates the development of a concise and easily digestible medium of information that allows consumers to gain insight into significant themes, events, and entities surrounding their areas of interest, possibly over a specific time period, without having to sift through reams of irrelevant material. This leads to the use of semantic analysis on news items in order to extract useful and distilled information from the corpus.

    This project aims to provide a coherent representation of news in a particular industry, by grouping articles into high level semantic clusters, extracting topics using LDA topic models, and providing condensed (?????) insight into the content discussed in the articles by extracting semantic triples for each topic.
